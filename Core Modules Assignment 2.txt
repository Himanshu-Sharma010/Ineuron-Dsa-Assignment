Q.1
There are three types of the conditional operator in Java:

1.AND
2.OR
3.Ternary Operator

AND:
The operator is applied between two Boolean expressions. It is denoted by the two AND operators (&&). It returns true if and only if both expressions are true, else returns false.

OR:
The operator is applied between two Boolean expressions. It is denoted by the two OR operator (||). It returns true if any of the expression is true, else returns false.

Ternary Operator
The meaning of ternary is composed of three parts. The ternary operator (? :) consists of three operands. It is used to evaluate Boolean expressions.


Q.2
There are three types of operators based on the number of operands. An operator is called a unary, binary, or ternary operator based on the number of operands. If an operator takes one operand, it is called a unary operator; if it takes two operands, it is called a binary operator; if it takes three operands, it is called a ternary operator.


Q.3
The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones. Thus, it is like an if-else-if ladder statement. It works with a lot of data types.


Q.4
Conditional statements in Java are the executable block of code (or branch to a specific code) dependent on certain conditions. These statements are also known as decision statements or selection statements in Java.

Following are the statements covered under conditional statements in Java:

1.If statement
2.If else statement
3.Switch Statement


Q.5
 if (Condition) { Statement1; }
 else { Statement2; }


Q.6
In Java, string equals() method compares the two given strings based on the data/content of the string.

Q.7
 mutable strings are those strings whose content can be changed without creating a new object. StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable versions of String in java.

like: 1.StringBuilder vider = new StringBuilder("Himanshu");
      2.StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer("Ineuron");

Q.8
public class SortingString {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter a string value: ");
      String str = sc.nextLine();
      char charArray[] = str.toCharArray();
      Arrays.sort(charArray);
      System.out.println(new String(charArray));
   }
}


Q.9
class Check_Letter
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String str = "String Exercises";
		boolean pre = false;
		for(int i = 0;i<str.length();i++)
		{
			if(str.charAt(i) == 'e')
			{
				pre=true;
				break;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(pre);
	}
}




Q.10
The Java string constant pool is an area in heap memory where Java stores literal string values.
